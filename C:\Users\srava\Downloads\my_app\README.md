# MindMirror+ - The AI Wellness Companion

MindMirror+ is a web application designed as a personal wellness companion. It uses AI to provide users with cognitive exercises, supportive messages, and a space for reflection, tailored to different age groups.

- **Echoes of Tomorrow**: A unique feature where users can share a current worry and receive a supportive "memory" from a wiser, future version of themselves, generated by AI.
- **Whispers & Community**: A space to connect with professional therapists (or helpers for younger users) and a community of peers.
- **Progress Journal / Feelings Garden**: Visualize your emotional journey, track reflections, and celebrate personal milestones and achievements.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js with React
- **AI**: Google Gemini via Genkit
- **UI**: ShadCN UI Components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: Firebase Hosting

## Running the Application Locally

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install the necessary npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Development Server

To run the app in development mode with live reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

### 3. Build and Serve the Static Version

To create a production-ready static build of the application (which is what gets deployed to Firebase Hosting):

1.  **Build the app:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will generate a static site in the `out` directory.

2.  **Serve the static site locally:**
    The best way to preview the static build is with the `serve` package. If you don't have it, install it globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g serve
    ```
    Then, serve the `out` directory:
    ```bash
    serve out
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (the port may vary). This is the most accurate way to test what will be deployed.
